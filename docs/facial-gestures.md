# Facial Gestures

Echo's facial gesture recognition provides an innovative accessibility solution for users with limited mobility. Using advanced computer vision technology, users can control the app through facial movements, making communication more accessible.

## Overview

Facial gesture recognition transforms your device's front-facing camera into a powerful accessibility tool. By detecting specific facial movements, Echo allows hands-free navigation and control, opening up communication possibilities for users who cannot use traditional touch interfaces.

## Technology

### ARKit Integration
Echo uses Apple's ARKit framework for facial gesture detection:
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant gesture recognition with minimal latency
- **High Accuracy**: Precise detection of subtle facial movements
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing occurs on-device with no data transmission
- **Adaptive Technology**: Automatically uses the best available hardware

### Hardware Compatibility
- **TrueDepth Cameras**: Enhanced precision on iPhone X and later Pro models, iPad Pro
- **Neural Engine**: Advanced processing on A12 Bionic and later chips
- **Standard Cameras**: Basic functionality on supported older devices

## Gesture Categories

Echo organizes facial gestures into three technical categories, each with specialized threshold controls for optimal user experience:

### Intensity-Based Gestures
These gestures use facial muscle intensity and are measured on a 0-100% scale:

#### Eye Gestures
Perfect for users who retain good eye muscle control:
- **Blink Detection**: Left, right, or either eye
- **Sustained Eye States**: Keeping eyes open or closed
- **Wink Patterns**: Single or double winks

#### Mouth and Jaw Gestures
Ideal for users with facial muscle control:
- **Jaw Movements**: Open, forward, left, right
- **Mouth Expressions**: Smile, frown, pucker, funnel
- **Lip Movements**: Various lip positions and movements

#### Eyebrow and Facial Gestures
Subtle but effective control options:
- **Brow Raises**: Inner, outer, left, right
- **Brow Furrows**: Downward movements
- **Cheek Movements**: Puffing, squinting
- **Nose Movements**: Sneering, flaring

### Angular-Based Gestures
These gestures measure head movement angles in degrees:

#### Head Movement Gestures
For users who can move their head:
- **Nodding**: Up and down movements (measured in degrees of pitch)
- **Shaking**: Left and right movements (measured in degrees of yaw)
- **Tilting**: Side-to-side head tilts (measured in degrees of roll)

### Composite Gestures
These gestures use complex calculations combining multiple facial features:

#### Gaze Direction
Advanced eye tracking for precise control:
- **Looking Up/Down**: Vertical gaze movement
- **Looking Left/Right**: Horizontal gaze movement
- **Combined Gaze**: Multi-directional eye positioning

## Configuration

### Gesture Setup Process
1. **Access Settings**: Navigate to Settings → Access Options
2. **Enable Feature**: Turn on "Facial Gestures"
3. **Add Gestures**: Tap "Facial Gesture Switches"
4. **Choose Method**: Manual selection or auto-detection
5. **Configure Actions**: Assign tap and hold actions
6. **Adjust Thresholds**: Use context-aware controls with helpful descriptions
7. **Test Setup**: Use preview mode to verify detection with real-time feedback

### User Experience Improvements
Echo's threshold controls are designed for clarity and ease of use:
- **Context-Aware Labels**: Instead of generic "Threshold," see "Intensity Required," "Movement Amount," or "Sensitivity"
- **Meaningful Units**: View thresholds in percentages for intensity, degrees for head movements, or levels for gaze
- **Helpful Descriptions**: Each gesture includes guidance like "How much you need to close your eyes"
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time indicators show current gesture values against your threshold settings

### Threshold Configuration
Echo provides intelligent, context-aware threshold controls that adapt to each gesture type:

#### Intensity-Based Gesture Controls
For facial muscle movements (blinks, smiles, jaw movements):
- **"Intensity Required"**: Controls how much muscle activation is needed
- **Percentage Display**: Shows threshold as "85% intensity" for clear understanding
- **Range**: Typically 50-95% for reliable detection without false triggers

#### Angular-Based Gesture Controls
For head movements (nod, shake, tilt):
- **"Movement Amount"**: Controls how far you need to move your head
- **Degree Display**: Shows threshold as "8° movement" for precise control
- **Range**: Typically 3-17° for comfortable, deliberate movements

#### Composite Gesture Controls
For gaze direction and complex movements:
- **"Sensitivity"**: Controls detection responsiveness
- **Level Display**: Shows threshold as "Level 4/10" for intuitive adjustment
- **Range**: 10 levels from very sensitive to very precise

#### Universal Features
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time threshold indicators during testing
- **Contextual Descriptions**: Helpful explanations like "How much you need to close your eyes"
- **Fine-tuning**: Precise control tailored to individual capabilities
- **Hold Duration**: Separate timing controls for tap vs. hold actions

### Action Mapping
Gestures can trigger various actions:
- **Navigation**: Move through vocabulary items
- **Selection**: Choose current item
- **Deletion**: Remove characters or words
- **Scanning**: Start or control scanning modes
- **Custom Actions**: App-specific functions

## Auto-Detection Feature

### How It Works
Echo's intelligent auto-detection system simplifies gesture setup:
1. **Baseline Establishment**: Records your neutral facial state
2. **Gesture Performance**: You perform your chosen movement
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes movement characteristics
4. **Automatic Configuration**: Selects and configures the best-matching gesture

### Benefits
- **Simplified Setup**: No need to understand technical gesture names
- **Personalized Detection**: Adapts to your unique movement patterns
- **Optimal Sensitivity**: Automatically sets appropriate thresholds
- **Quick Configuration**: Faster than manual gesture selection

## Best Practices

### Environment Setup
- **Lighting**: Ensure good, even lighting on your face
- **Background**: Use a contrasting background when possible
- **Distance**: Position device 12-24 inches from your face
- **Angle**: Keep device at eye level or slightly below

### Gesture Performance
- **Deliberate Movements**: Make clear, intentional gestures
- **Consistent Positioning**: Maintain stable head position
- **Practice**: Regular use improves recognition accuracy
- **Rest Periods**: Take breaks to prevent fatigue

### Troubleshooting

#### Detection Issues
- **Inconsistent Detection**: Check lighting and positioning
- **No Detection**: Verify camera permissions and device compatibility
- **Performance Issues**: Close other camera-using apps

#### Threshold Adjustment
- **False Triggers**:
  - For intensity gestures: Increase "Intensity Required" percentage
  - For head movements: Increase "Movement Amount" degrees
  - For gaze gestures: Decrease "Sensitivity" level
- **Missed Gestures**:
  - For intensity gestures: Decrease "Intensity Required" percentage
  - For head movements: Decrease "Movement Amount" degrees
  - For gaze gestures: Increase "Sensitivity" level
- **Understanding Thresholds**: Use the contextual descriptions (e.g., "How much you need to close your eyes") to guide adjustments
